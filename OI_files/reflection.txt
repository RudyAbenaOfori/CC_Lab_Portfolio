Project Description:
My inspiration for creating this optical illusion was a childhood memory. I was a great fan of the Power Puff Girls cartoon series, and I wanted to recreate the hypnotizing loop effect. It's an unending loop of colored hearts that continuously draws you in.
Process:

It took me a while to figure out the logic for this optical illusion. My process started with researching and obtaining a gif of the sensational Power Puff Girls' hypnotizing loop. I finally settled on one I wanted to emulate.

I initially tried mapping shapes to the time functions in P5.js; however, it didn't quite give me the results I wanted. I thought through the project repeatedly and tried different approaches, but it worked out eventually when I talked through the logic with a couple of friends and employed the logic from the class on arrays we had just had.

It was honestly slightly tough to put everything together, but it eventually worked out well and was worth it. I will still work more on the aesthetic. I incorporated a code snippet from ronikaufman/sketches as well. It gave me great insight into using arrays for this project. Truly, code is meant to be reused and built upon to create greater things.


How might my optical illusion get deployed in the world around:
This optical illusion was an idea I got from a childhood cartoon that was a favorite of mine. Thus, it can be employed in many more animations, videos, gifs, etc., to drive home a point. In the Power Puff Girls animation, it was used as a tool for hypnotism. I believe in that same line of thought it could be used as a mental destressing tool for people. This was an interesting project to work on.
