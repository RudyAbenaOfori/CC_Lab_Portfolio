Assignment: Data Portrait

Data Portrait Description
I decided to create a data portrait of my browsing habits over seven days. Starting from Saturday, October 12, 2024, I collated data on my browsing history until Friday, October 18, 2024. My data portrait displays details on the days and number of times I browsed, encased in bubbles. Thus, my Data Portrait is an exhibition of a bubble galore, depicting my browsing habits.


Reading Instructions For Viewers
It's very simple to read my browsing data portrait; you just have to pay attention to the signs.

1. First,I put the different day's portraits in a time loop of 60 seconds; this means you have approximately 8 seconds to interact with each day.

2. On each day's page, I boldly display the browsing history day, the date, the collated number of times I browsed, and the specific times in bubbles.

3. If you want to read the specific times, note that all the bubbles have the same time. To read them, you'd have to click on the canvas to iterate through a list of the times.

4. Remember to read fast because after 8 seconds, the day will change.


Design Process
Admittedly, the code for this design was the longest I had ever worked on. I started by collecting data of my browsing history and organizing it in a spreadsheet file. Then I put the information of the date and times in different arrays so I could work with them. My idea was to work with bubbles, so I researched different 2D bubble illustrations and tried to include them in different sketches for different days. I loved the outcome after coding about three pages, but the code started to become too long and cumbersome after four sketches and began throwing numerous bugs.

Overall Assignment Reflection
Overall, I loved working on this Data Portrait assignment. It gave me an opportunity to explore something I had really loved as a child: bubbles. It also taught me a lot about patience because I became quite frustrated at some points due to the bugs it threw.


Lessons Learned through Self-Tracking Process
I learned quite a number of things through this self-tracking process. First, I was surprised to discover how small the number of times I browsed was. I learned I spent more time on some sites than I did on others, which gave me more insight into what I liked. I also learned a lot about debugging while working on this project.


What Was Gained / Lost Through the Process of Data Visualization?
I gained a lot of insight from this process, although I felt the amount of time I spent browsing could not be fully captured in this data. That was a slight loss of accuracy in that aspect. Although the times were recorded, the duration spent on sites was lost in the collation of data.
